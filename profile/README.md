## Hi there 👋

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

# Welcome to WIRE-AI 👋

Our group, WIldfire REsearch - Analytics Initiative (WIRE-AI), has been working on an NSERC Alliance Mission project since 2022. 
Our goal is to assist forest fire researchers and practitioners with machine learning/deep learning (ML/DL) models, tools, frameworks, and advanced datasets. 
These resources enable the application of data-driven techniques to model forest fire growth, predict forest fire risk, and estimate burnt areas. 
Our research objectives also include the use of IoT-based sensors, drones, crowd-sourced data, and state-of-the-art communication technologies for remote forest monitoring, forest fire suppression planning, and ensuring public safety.

We are a team of developers, data scientists/engineers, machine learning engineers and simulation modellers focused on building open-source tools for geospatial analysis and machine learning.
The collaborative team is from [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca/), and [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca/) along with our indestrial partners from [Cistel Technology](https://cistel.com/) and [Hegyi Geomatics](https://hegyigeomatics.com/).
